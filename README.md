# Clean Sweep System

This project is designed to simulate an intelligent robot vacuum cleaner, named **Clean Sweep**, that autonomously navigates and cleans a typical household environment. The project implements two core components: a **Control System** and a **Sensor Simulator**. The project is developed using **Spring Boot** and **Java** with a clean architecture to demonstrate object-oriented design principles.

## Project Overview

The **Clean Sweep System** is composed of several modules that work together to provide functionality for:

- **Navigation and Control**: Allows the vacuum to move around the floor plan, avoid obstacles, and return to its charging station when low on power.
- **Dirt Detection and Cleaning**: Detects and cleans dirt based on the current surface type and dirt quantity.
- **Power Management**: Manages battery life based on the surface type and task requirements.
- **Sensor Simulation**: Simulates the sensor data to allow the control system to react as if operating in a real-world environment.

The system is built to follow agile methodologies and object-oriented principles, ensuring high modularity and maintainability.
